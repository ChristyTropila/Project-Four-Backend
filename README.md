# Trick or Treat
A Halloween trivia game implementing a React.js frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend. This is my first React application and also my first time working with a google maps api. 
This project integrates everything I learned in module 4 including the ability to: 

 * Design and architect features across frontend and backend
 * Communicate and collaborate in a technical environment
 * Build and iterate on a project MVP
 * Debug issues in small- to medium-sized projects
 * Integrate React.js and Rails

Trick or Treat was inspired by my love for Halloween. I wanted to challenge myself and incorprate a google maps to dynamically create trivia questions. If the user correctly answers the trivia question, they receive a treat, if incorrect, a trick.

# User Stories

* User can login or create new registration
* User can navigate the map and answer different trivia questions
* User can view their bucket to see a list of all their tricks and treats
* User can update their profile
* User can delete items from their bucket
